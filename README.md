# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This project aims to explore and analyze the publicly available COVID-19 dataset from Our World in Data (via Kaggle) to understand the trends and patterns of the pandemic across different countries. The analysis focuses on total cases, total deaths, new cases, death rates, and vaccination progress for a selected set of countries (initially Kenya, USA, and India), with an optional global overview using a choropleth map.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

* Load and explore the structure of the COVID-19 dataset.
* Clean and prepare the data for analysis by filtering countries, handling missing values, and converting data types.
* Generate descriptive statistics and visualize trends in total cases, total deaths, daily new cases, and death rates over time for selected countries.
* Analyze and visualize the progress of vaccination rollouts in the selected countries.
* (Optional) Visualize the global distribution of total cases using a choropleth map.
* Summarize key insights and highlight any interesting patterns or anomalies observed in the data.

## Tools and Libraries Used

* **pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
* **matplotlib:** For creating basic plots and visualizations.
* **seaborn:** For enhanced and statistical data visualizations.
* **plotly.express:** For creating interactive visualizations, specifically the choropleth map.

## How to Run/View the Project

This project is typically executed using a Python environment, such as Jupyter Notebook or a standard Python script. To run or view the analysis:

1.  **Download the Dataset:**
    * Download the `owid-covid-data.csv` file from the Kaggle link: [https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandhyakrishnan02/latest-covid-19-dataset-worldwide?resource=download](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sandhyakrishnan02/latest-covid-19-dataset-worldwide?resource=download)
    * Save the downloaded CSV file in the same directory as your Python script or notebook, or provide the correct file path in the code.

2.  **Install Libraries:**
    * Ensure you have the necessary libraries installed. You can install them using pip:
        ```bash
        pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn plotly
        ```

3.  **Run the Python Script or Notebook:**
    * Execute the Python script (e.g., `main.py`) or open and run the Jupyter Notebook (e.g., `covid_analysis.ipynb`) containing the code developed for this project. The code will load the data, perform the cleaning, analysis, and generate the visualizations.
    * The output, including plots and printed insights, will be displayed in your console or within the Jupyter Notebook.

## Insights and Reflections

*(This section will be populated with specific insights derived from the data after the analysis is run. Below are some general examples of the type of insights that might be found):*

* The trajectory of total COVID-19 cases varied significantly among Kenya, the USA, and India, indicating different phases and scales of outbreaks.
* The calculated death rate (total deaths / total cases) showed notable differences between the selected countries, potentially reflecting variations in healthcare systems and pandemic management strategies.
* Vaccination rollouts commenced at different times and progressed at varying speeds in the three countries, as evidenced by the cumulative vaccination trends.
* *(If a choropleth map was generated)* The global distribution of total COVID-19 cases as of the latest date highlighted regions most affected by the pandemic.
* Anomalies such as sudden spikes in new cases in a specific country might correlate with known events or policy changes during that period.
* Further investigation could explore the correlation between vaccination rates and the subsequent trends in new cases and deaths within each country.

This project provides a foundational analysis of the COVID-19 dataset. Further steps could involve more advanced statistical analysis, exploring additional variables within the dataset, and incorporating external data sources (e.g., population data) for a more comprehensive understanding of the pandemic's dynamics.
